    to learn faster all topics given in class and the main objective was to use
    the RGB scale to change colors of a specific place. The appearance of it is
    not the main goal. Moreover, the penguin was created by FreeCodeCamp and it
    was used to be interactive with the colors and each part of the penguin.
